# PyCalculator-Simplified
This is a simple python calculator which adds, subtracts, multiplies and divides. Nothing more, nothing less.
You can use this in any situation and it comes in handy if you might be using a linux pc/laptop.
There is no install file as it is quite a small file in size so if you git clone it or download it as a zip file, 
it wont take up any space when extracted at all. 

New and improved versions will come out at least every month and if there isn't an update to the code, i will
be constantly looking at the code to try and improve it.

Please enjoy and if you like it, it doesn't hurt to leave a star to help my new coder reputation.

Another way to see and run the code online is going to where I wrote it (EDIT PROTECTION ENABLED) its here: https://pycalculator-simplified.henrysargeant20.repl.run/

Also, I am in the current progress of making an self-esteem A.I in python which the first version will be bought out
sometime this year (SECRET)
